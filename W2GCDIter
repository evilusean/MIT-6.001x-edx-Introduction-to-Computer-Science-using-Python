def gcdIter(a, b):
    '''
    a, b: positive integers
    
    returns: a positive integer, the greatest common divisor of a & b.
    Write an iterative function, gcdIter(a, b), that implements this idea. One easy way to do this is to begin with a test value equal to the smaller of the two input arguments, and iteratively reduce this test value by 1 until you either reach a case where the test divides both a and b without remainder, or you reach 1.
def gcdIter(a, b):
    '''
    # Your code here
    gcd = 1
    c = min(a, b)
    for n in range(c, 1, -1):
        if (a % n == 0) and (b % n == 0):
            gcd = n
            break
        else:
            gcd = 1
    return gcd
