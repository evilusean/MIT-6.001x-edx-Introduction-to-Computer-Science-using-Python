    isMyNumber: Procedure that hides a secret number. 
     It takes as a parameter one number and returns:
     *  -1 if the number is less than the secret number
     *  0 if the number is equal to the secret number
     *  1 if the number is greater than the secret number
 
    returns: integer, the secret number
    Answer the following question without running the code. The procedure isMyNumber is used to hide a secret number (integer). It takes an integer x as a parameter and compares it to the secret number. It returns:

-1 if the parameter x is less than the secret number

0 if the parameter x is correct

1 if the parameter x is greater than the secret number

The following procedure, jumpAndBackPedal, attempts to guess a secret number. The only way it can interact with the secret number is through the isMyNumber procedure explained above.

Unfortunately, the implementation given does not correctly return the secret number. Please fix the errors in the code such that jumpAndBackpedal correctly returns the secret number.
